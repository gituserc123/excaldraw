【G72】中级语法开篇：关系代词
【练习】

一、概念题

定从的主句肯定是 1._______________的

定从主句里面被修饰的名词叫作2._______________

定从里面的引导词，我们也把它叫作3._______________

定语从句的连接词有三大作用：一是引导从句，二是在从句中作成分，三是4._______________

定从关系词推导步骤：

一是确定该句子为5._______________

二是划出6._______________

三是将7._______________代入从句，看作何成分

四是根据8._______________所作成分，推出9._______________

在Morty老师的眼里，关系词的出现，本质上是一种避免10._______________

若先行词带入从句作11._______________，那么推出该句子引导词应为12._______________

若先行词带入从句作状语，则推出该句子的引导词应为13._______________

若先行词带入从句作定语，则推出该句子的引导词应为14._______________

请注意：常见的引导词15._______________和16._______________不引导定语从句

二、为下列句子填上合适的连接词

I have an apple 17. _______________ color is red.

I know a man 18. _______________ name is Morty.

This is the place 19. _______________ the party is to be held.

This is the place 20. _______________ makes me sad.

This is the day 21. _______________ we meet each other.

This is the day 22. _______________ we choose.

This is the reason 23. _______________ she cried.

This is the reason 24. _______________ she told me.

This is the reason 25. _______________ leads me here.

【G73】关系词三大技巧
【练习】

一、概念题

我们在判断定语从句的从句部分是否缺成分的时候，有三大技巧：

第1，从句是否缺主宾表这三种成分，最难看出来的是缺1._______________，因此我们就要刻意观察从句是否有2._______________，3._______________或者是能接双宾语的4._______________

第2，被动即5._______________，6._______________的被动除外

第3，关系代词作7._______________可以省略（非限制性定语从句不能省）

二、判断下列句子是否完整

The letter was delivered. 8._______________

The letter was delivered to. 9._______________

The letter was delivered by. 10._______________

The letter was written. 11._______________

The letter was sent. 12._______________

I was sent. 13._______________

I sent him. 14._______________

I sent him a letter. 15._______________

I sent the letter. 16._______________

I write. 17._______________

I write a lot. 18._______________

Jade is a young mother. 19._______________

Jade is a young mother in the prime. 20._______________

Jade is a young mother in the prime of her life. 21._______________

An acid attack leaves her. 22._______________

An acid attack leaves her severely burned. 23._______________

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
【G74】关系副词
一、概念题

当一个句子为定语从句，且从句是完整的，这个时候我们就可以推出这个句子的引导词/关系词应该是1._______________或2._______________

如果先行词带入从句修饰的是动词或作3._______________（成分），那么我们可以判定，这个句子的引导词/关系词应为4._______________

如果先行词带入从句是从地点角度修饰动词，那么这个句子的引导词/关系词应为5._______________

如果先行词带入从句是从6._______________角度修饰动词，那么这个句子的引导词/关系词应为7._______________

如果先行词带入从句是从原因角度修饰动词，那么这个句子的引导词/关系词应为8._______________

在按照Morty老师的方法找定语从句的关系词的时候，有一个很容易搞混的点是，我们说一整个句子修饰一个名词，是在判定这个句子是定语从句，并且被修饰的那个名词就是先行词。而又把先行词带入从句，是因为关系词9._______________先行词，我们通过观察先行词带入从句能做什么成分，就可以推导出10._______________在从句中作什么成分

二、做题步骤练习

I hate to talk about that period 30. _______________ I found myself diffident and often lost in self-accusation.

这个句子第一个谓语动词是11._______________

这个句子第二个谓语动词是12._______________

这个句子13._______________第三个谓语动词

空格处是14._______________所在的位置

划分主从句，空格前是15._______________，空格及以后是16._______________

我们可以看出，主句是17._______________的，因此这个句子可能是18._______________

又因为整个从句在修饰19._______________，所以我们判定这个句子为20._______________

再然后，我们划出先行词21._______________，把它带入22._______________，而我们又发现从句是23._______________的，所以根据排除法，先行词带入从句要么作24._______________，要么作25._______________，最后我们发现先行词修饰的是26._______________，最终判断出先行词带入从句作27._______________，又因为先行词28._______________关系词，最终我们判定出空格处应该填关系29._______________，即30._______________

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
【G75】关系副词与介词+which
一、填空题

为什么关系副词可以改成介词+which？

归根到底的原因是，关系副词在从句中作1._______________，而介词+which在从句中也是作2._______________，两者是替代关系。

关系副词where常常可以转换成3._______________，4._______________或5._______________

关系副词when常常可以转换成6._______________，7._______________或8._______________

关系副词why通常只能转换成9._______________

How 10._______________引导定语从句

在Morty老师的眼中，关系副词11._______________介词+which

二、做题步骤练习

I hate to talk about that period 12. _______________ I found myself diffident and often lost in self-accusation.

前面的步骤和上节课一样，我们可以得出空格处可以填when，但是空格处也可以填介词+which，我们接着来推导介词：

因为我们把that period带入从句的过程中发现，从句是13._______________的，因此that period不能直接带入从句作成分，这个时候我们就要想办法加一个14._______________，于是我们把that period带入从句就变成了：

I found myself diffident and often lost in self-accusation 15. _______________ that period.

我们再用which来替代that period，所以空格处应该填16._______________

三、把下列句子改成介词+which的形式

Find the desk 17. _______________ there is a book.

This is the factory 18. _______________ your shoes were made.

I will never forget the moment 19. _______________ Beijing came out of Samaranch’s mouth.

No more excuses 20. _______________ Man United lose the game.

This is the day 21. _______________ we met each other.

June will be the month 22. _______________ Chengdu hosts the World University Games.

I trust no words 23. _______________ comes from his mouth.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
【G76】关系形容词
一、概念题

关系形容词的判断步骤：

1，首先判定句子为1._______________

2，主从句都得2._______________，即不选关系3._______________

3，从句有名词属于4._______________，即不选关系5._______________

4，若从句名词前有6._______________，则用7._______________结构，即8._______________定语；若从句名词前无9._______________，则用10._______________结构，即11._______________定语

5，从句名词是12._______________或13._______________，只用14._______________结构，即15._______________定语

注意：第4和第5步是选择关系，即只可能出现其中的一种情况

Whose本质上是16._______________定语；of结构本质上是17._______________定语

用of结构时，后面跟which还是whom是由18._______________决定的。即指物用of 19._______________，指人用of 20._______________

二、给下列句子填上恰当的连接词

I have an apple 21. _______________ the color is red.

I know a man 22._______________ the name is Morty.

I have many friends, 23._______________ some are businessmen.

I have many friends; 24._______________ some are businessmen.

I have many friends, 25._______________ some are businessmen.

I have many friends, 26._______________ nearly one-third are businessmen.

I have many friends, 27._______________ nearly one-third of them are businessmen.

I have many friends; 28._______________ nearly one-third of them are businessmen.

I have many friends; 29._______________ nearly one-third 30._______________ businessmen.

I have many friends; 31._____________nearly one-third of them 32._____________ businessmen.

I have many books; 33._______________ nearly one-third are novels.

I have many books, 34._______________nearly one-third are novels.

I have many books, 35._______________ stories are fictional.

I have many books, 36._______________ the stories are fictional.

I have many books; 37._______________ the stories are fictional.

I have plenty of money, 38._______________ the power 39._______________ big.

I have plenty of money, 40._______________ one-third 41._______________ earned through Internet.

I have plenty of friends, 42._______________ one-third 43._______________ made through Internet.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
【G77】非限制性定语从句
一、概念题

限制性定语从句与非限制性定语从句的区别

本质上：

限制性定语从句的本质是从句部分要把先行词的范围变1._______________；而非限制性定语从句的本质是，主句的先行词已经是2._______________了，所以后面的从句部分，并没有把先行词范围变3._______________，而更像是一种补充说明而已

引导词上：

限制性定语从句关系代词部分有4._______________，而非限制性定语从句关系代词部分无5._______________

限制性定语从句关系副词部分有6._______________，而非限制性定语从句关系副词部分无7._______________

用法上：

限制性定语从句是要把8._______________的名词范围变9._______________；而非限制性定语从句是补充说明主句中的10._______________名词

限制性定语从句只能修饰一个11._______________；而非限制性定语从句既可以修饰12._______________，也可以代替13._______________，且这个时候只能用14._______________或15._______________来替代上述功能

之所以代替整个句子只能用在非限制性定语从句中，是因为我们倾向于把一整句话看作是16._______________的，而只能用17._______________或18._______________来代替整句话，其本质是我们倾向于认为一整句话是一个19._______________，而非一个20._______________

非限制性定语从句中，which和as代整句话的区别：

意思上：

Which我们倾向于翻译为21._______________；而as我们倾向于翻译为22._______________

位置上：

Which引导的从句位于主句之23._______________；而as引导的从句可以位于主句的24._______________

本质上，即时间上：

Which引导的从句发生在主句之25._______________，倾向于讲一个具体的、特定的事情；而as不26._______________先后，更多的是讲一个一般的规律、现象、既定事实（并基于这个既定事实引出后面的话题）等

二、填空题

27. ___________ has been announced, we shall have our final exams next month.

It is said 28.___________we shall have our final exams next month.

China is a country with a long history, 29._______________ is known to us all.


Tom did not pass the exam, 30._______________ made his mother very angry.

Here is the English grammar book 31._______________, 32._______________ I have told you, will help to improve your English.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
【G78】定从其他重要问题
一、概念题

定从的主谓一致：

定从的主谓一致的意思是说，当关系代词作从句的1._______________时，其谓语动词的单复数不是由2._______________决定的，而是由3._______________决定的，因为本质上关系代词只是对4._______________的替代。

定从中只用that不用which的情况：

Morty的话：这里的情况非常繁琐，但是其实我们可以用排除法，你搞清楚只用which不用that的情况，那么剩下的情况都是用that比which多了，但前提是你得判断出这是5._______________，且从句6._______________，且先行词指7._______________时，才有以下区别

第1，当先行词为8._______________或被9._______________修饰时，只用that不用which

第2，当先行词是10._______________或最高级，或被其修饰时，只用that不用which

第3，当先行词被11._______________，12._______________或the last等修饰时，只用that不用which，这和第2点类似

第4，当主句是以13._______________或14._______________开头的疑问句时，只用that不用which

第5，当先行词既指15._______________又指16._______________时，只用that不用which

定从中只用which不用that的情况：

第1，17._______________定语从句中没有that

第2，18._______________后只接which，不接that

（注：这里的前提是定语从句，如in that等是状语从句连接词）

定从中只用as，不用that和which的情况：

当先行词含有19._______________，20._______________，21._______________或 the same时，只用as，不用that或which，其本质原因Morty老师认为是as倾向于表达某一类别，而非某一个体。比如the same that指同一 22._______________，the same as指同一 23._______________

二、填空题

24. Don’t talk about such things _______________ you don’t understand.


25. Don't talk about such things of________________ you are not sure.

26. He is one of the persons who _______________ invited.


27. He is the only one of the persons who _______________ invited.

28. It was our first class _______________ Mr. White taught us.

29. He is such a man _______________ doesn’t keep his promise.


30. Can you tell me the way _______________ you did the job？

31. Can you tell me the way _______________ leads to the station？

32. He did it in the same way _______________ you told him.


33. That’s all _______________ I want to say.

34. The room _______________ she lives is a large one.

35. Is there anything _______________ you want in this shop?

36. He talked about some writers and books _______________ were unknown to us all.

37. The predicateis that _______________ is said of the subject.

38. Who is the girl _______________ is singing in the hall?

39. I’ll tell you _______________ he told me last week. （一个词）

40. I’ll tell you _______________ he told me last week. （两个词）

41. I have bought the same dress _______________ she is wearing.

42. This is the same knife _______________ I lost.

【G84】名词性从句概述
一、概念题

一个句子用作1.__________叫作名词性从句。名词性从句包含了2.__________种从句，它们分别是3.__________从句、4.__________从句、5.__________从句和6.__________从句

所有从句做题步骤：

第一，判断7.__________

如果一个句子的主句是不完整的，那这个句子肯定是8.__________从句；如果一个句子的主句是完整的，那么接下来你要看主句中是否有9.__________名词，如果没有，那么这个句子要么是10.__________从句，要么是11.__________从句。如果有，那么你还要看从句是否12.__________这个名词，如果等同，该句子就是13.__________从句，即属于14.__________从句；如果不等同，则该句子要么是15.__________从句，要么是16.__________从句，但前者的可能性更大

第二，看17.__________在18.__________中作什么成分；也可以直接判断从句缺不缺成分。在Morty老师的体系里，从句缺成分的意思是从句缺19.__________，20.__________或21.__________；从句不缺成分的意思是连接词可能在从句中作22.__________，作23.__________或24.__________成分

第三，看25.__________

26.__________在名词性从句里面无27.__________，无28.__________，无29.__________，但有作用，作用就是连接主从句

名词性从句的引导词系统：

为了和定语从句区别开来，我们约定，定语从句的引导词也叫30.__________，名词性从句的引导词也叫31.__________

在Morty老师的体系里，名词性从句的连接词被分为32.__________种：

1，连接33.__________，词性34.__________，在从句中作35. __________，36. __________，37. __________

它们分别是：38.__________，39.__________，40.__________，41.__________，并且每个词后面都可以加上42.__________，一共是43.__________个连接词

2，连接44.__________，词性45.__________，在从句中作46.__________

它们分别是：47.__________，48.__________，49.__________，50.__________，并且大部分词也可以在后面加51.__________，其中52.__________不能在后面加53.__________，另外还有54.__________也可以作连接副词，但它后面不能加55.__________，所以常见的连接副词加起来总共是56.__________个

3，连接57.__________，词性58.__________，在从句中作59.__________

它们分别是：60.__________，61.__________，62.__________，并且每个词后面都可以加上63.__________，加起来一共是64.__________个

4，65.__________连接词，词性66.__________，在从句中67.__________作成分

这种连接词有且只有68.__________个，即69.__________

名词性从句连接词与定语从句连接词区别：

一、定语从句里面没有引导词70.__________和71.__________，而名词性从句里面有

二、名词性从句里很多引导词可能会带72.__________（后缀），而定语从句引导词则没有

三、定语从句引导词可能改成73.__________+ which，而名词性从句里面没有

四、定语从句里面that是74.__________，在从句中作75.__________，而名词性从句里面that是76.__________，在从句中77.__________成分

五、定语从句和名词性从句里面都有whose, 但是定语从句里面的whose可以改成78.__________，或79.__________，而名词性从句里的whose不能

Morty老师的话：这节课一定要彻底理解我讲的从句做题步骤，并深深地印入脑海里，成为你分析句子以及做题的习惯。

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
【G85】名词性从句六点注意事项
一、概念题

（1）判断从句类型看1.__________；选连接词看2.__________

（2）从句统一用3.__________语序

（3）宾语从句的4.__________个5.__________可以省略；宾语从句里6.__________可以替代whether，但是使用范围更小；宾语从句里介词后一般不用7.__________

宾语从句里只用whether不用if的情况：

第一，whether可以和8.__________连用，而if不行

第二，9.__________后面可以接whether而不可以接if

第三，10.__________句型里面可以用whether，而不可以用if

（4）同位语三要素：11.__________，12.__________，13.__________，用引导词14.__________的概率大于90%

（5）宾语从句可以省略成引导词+15.__________的形式，具体看G51

（6）一人得道，鸡犬升天（下节课讲）

二、填空题

16.__________ our team has won the game is no surprise.

这是一个17.__________从句，引导词在从句中18.__________作成分，我们可以把这个句子改成：

19.____________________________________________

20.__________ the meeting will be held is still a problem.

这是一个21.__________从句，引导词在从句中作22.__________

I’m not sure 23. __________ he will come.

I’m not sure 24. __________ he will come or not.

It is doubtful 25. __________ he will come.

It is doubtful 26. __________ he will come or not.

27.__________ breaks the law should be punished.

We will punish 28. __________ breaks the law.

Jack was soon told 29. __________ he did was not necessary.

三、判断题

30.__________ breaks the law should be punished.

因为breaks缺主语，所以这个句子是主句从句31.__________

因为should be punished缺主语，所以这个句子是主语从句32.__________

因为punished是及物动词，所以后面缺宾语33.__________

因为punished是及物动词，所以这个句子是宾语从句34.__________

因为breaks是及物动词，所以这个句子缺宾语35.__________

We will punish 36. __________ breaks the law.

Punish是及物动词，所以这个句子是宾语从句37.__________

Breaks是及物动词，所以这个句子是宾语从句38.__________

Breaks缺主语，所以这个句子是主语从句39.__________

Breaks缺主语，所以空格处应该填连接代词40.__________

What you said is true, isn’t it?

从句应该用陈述句语序，所以isn’t it是错误的41.__________

Why do you believe he’s not telling the truth?

这个句子的引导词是why在从句中作状语42.__________

Do you believe没有用陈述句语序，所以是错误的43.__________

Tell是vt2，所以后面还缺一个宾语44.__________

Tell是及物动词，所以这是一个宾语从句45.__________

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
【G86】一人得道鸡犬升天
一、概念题

引导词是属于1.__________的，且引导词要引导从句，所以一般情况下引导词都位于从句2.__________，且引导词要在从句中3.__________，所以Morty老师从理性的角度，把引导词作成分分为两种情况，一种情况是作4.__________，这时后面会接5.__________；另一种情况是不作6.__________，这时后面会接7.__________，以上两种情况都属于正常情况

一人得道鸡犬升天

当我们发现，从句的引导词后面既不是直接接的8.__________也不是直接接的9.__________，而是在引导词和10.__________之间插了一个词或若干词，这个时候我们就可以判断这种情况为一人得道，鸡犬升天了

具体判断方法是，如果引导词和主语之间夹杂的是名词，我们可以推出这时引导词应该用11.__________；如果引导词和主语之间夹杂的是12.__________或者13.__________，我们可以推出这时引导词应该用14.__________

二、填空题（并分辨哪些是一人得道鸡犬升天模型）

主句+引导词（作主语）+15.__________

主句+主语+16.__________

主句+引导词（不作主语）+17.__________+18.__________（一般情况）

主句+19.__________+主语+20.__________

主句+引导词+名词+21.__________+谓语

主句+22.__________+形容词+23.__________+谓语

主句+24.__________+副词+25.__________+谓语

主句+引导词+26.__________+名词+27.__________+谓语

主句+引导词+28.__________+形容词+29.__________+谓语

主句+30.__________+31.__________+32.__________+名词（第一种可能）

造句：33.________________________________________

主句+34.__________+35.__________+36.__________+名词（第二种可能）

造句：37.________________________________________

主句+38.__________+39.__________+40.__________+名词（第三种可能）

主句+42.__________+43.__________+44.__________+名词（第四种可能）

造句：45. ________________________________________

主句+46.__________+47.__________+48.__________+名词（第五种可能）

造句：49. ________________________________________

主句+50.__________+51.__________+52.__________+名词（第六种可能）

造句：53. ________________________________________

【G91】初探状语从句
一、概念题

状语从句的定义：一个句子去修饰另外一个句子里面的1.__________、2.__________、3.__________或4.__________，但主要是修饰另外一个句子里的5.__________

在英语中，两个句子必须需要6.__________个连接词来连接，如果这个连接词是表逻辑的，那么有两种可能，一种是7.__________连词，这时候，这两个句子合成的句子就是我们所谓的8.__________，并且常见的有9.__________种逻辑关系。这种连接词的代表有4个，分别是10.__________，11.__________，12.__________和13.__________；另一种是14.__________连词，这时候，两个句子合成的句子就是我们所谓的15.__________，并且常见的有9种逻辑关系，它们分别是：

以when为代表的16.__________状语从句

以where为代表的17.__________状语从句

以because为代表的18.__________状语从句

以if为代表的19.__________状语从句

以so that为代表的20.__________状语从句

以so…that为代表的21.__________状语从句

以as为代表的22.__________状语从句

以than为代表的23.__________状语从句

以although为代表的24.__________状语从句

综上所述，在Morty老师的体系里，英语的逻辑关系总共有25.__________种，掌握这些逻辑关系是你理解句子，理解文章的关键。

状语从句四大考点：

一是考26.__________，即我们所谓的27.__________，具体是指在状语从句中，主句用一般将来时表将来，从句用28.__________时表29.__________

二是考30.__________，这是所有从句的重要考点

三是考31.__________，这是难点

四是考32.__________，这也是难点

二、填空题（或用所给词的正确形式填空）

33.__________ she is a child, she knows a lot.

The more I can do for you, the 34.__________ I’ll be. (happy)

He talks 35.__________ he had been to the moon.

He is 36.__________ a good teacher 37.__________ the students love and respect him.

I shall go to the park 38.__________ it 39.__________. (rain)

I had 40.__________ got home 41.__________ it began to rain.

42.__________ there is water, there is life.

He studied hard 43.__________ he could catch up with his classmates.

Since you 44.__________ very busy, I won't trouble you. (are)

Even if I fail, I 45.__________ heart. (lose)

I used to love you 46.__________ I used to love the ocean.

I like sitting in the dark 47.__________ she loves dancing in the park.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
【G92】when-while-as困难版
【练习】

一、概念题

表示一…就应该用引导词1.__________

表突发状况得用引导词2.__________，且有三种常见的突发状况，它们分别是3.____________________，4.____________________，和have just finished something when

当从句表示时间5.__________，即从句的动词用的是6.__________动词的时候，引导词用when和while都可以

7.__________和8.__________还可以表转折，这里可以归为并列句，前者表转折的时候可以翻译成9.__________，或者说他明明可以选择行动A的时候，他却选择了行动B；后者表转折的时候可以翻译成10.__________，是比较明显的两者前后对比

二、填空题

Mary was watching short videos 11.__________ her mother was sweeping the floor.

He chose to walk home12.__________ he could catch a bus.

13.__________ we will hold the meeting hasn’t been decided yet.

We got to know each other 14.__________ 15.__________ in high school. (study)

He had just got married 16.__________ the war broke out.

I don’t know 17.__________ I can see her again.

He did it all by himself 18.__________ he could hire a person.

I read the book 19.__________ I was on the plane.

20.__________ lead is added to petrol, it improves the car’s performance.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
【G93】when-while-as简化版
一、概念题

when既可以表时间1.__________，也可以表时间2.__________，即when后面既可以接3.__________动词，也可以接4.__________动词，而while只能表时间5.__________，所以while后面只能接6.__________动词

when可以表7.__________状况

when 可以表8.__________，9.__________现象

when可以表之10.__________，而while和as不行

主从句都是进行时，一般用11.__________

表“随着”一般用12.__________

表“一边…一边…”一般用13.__________

when和while引导的从句，条件允许的情况下，可以14.__________成非谓语形式，而as不行，原因是，as省略了容易产生15.__________

二、填空题

16. I shall tell her the good news__________ she comes.

17. __________the day went on, the weather got worse.（1990全国）

18.It just isn't fair__________ I was working as a waiter last month, my friends were lying on the beach. （2009辽宁）

19.Mary likes watching short videos __________ she does homework.

20. __________you get stronger, you will be more confident.

21.Peter was so excited__________ he received an invitation from his friend to visit Chongqing．(2009重庆)

22.I had just stepped out of the bathroom and was busily drying myself with a towel__________ I heard the steps．(2006湖南)

23.It suddenly started to rain__________ we were playing football.

24.We were playing football__________ it suddenly started to rain.

25.I always sing __________I walk.

26.Call me __________ you’ve finished.

27.__________ in Rome, do as the Romans do.

28.We will be less flexible __________ we get old.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
【G94】before-after-since-when
一、概念题

before和after都是在1.__________的事之前或之后，而这个事可以是2.__________的，也可以是3.__________的。since表示从4.__________到5.__________，因此since接的从句部分用6.__________（时态），主句那边用7.__________或8.__________，when可以表示过去的时间9.__________，也可以表示过去的时间10.__________，可以表示将来的时间11.__________，也可以表示将来的时间12.__________

before和ago的区别：

第一，before是以13.__________的事为参照点，这件事可以是14.__________的，也可以是15.__________的，而ago是以16.__________为参照点

第二，before可以作介词，因此它后面可以接17.__________，而ago是副词，后面不可以接18.__________

第三，before可以作连词，因为它后面可以接19.__________，而ago是副词，后面不可以接20.__________

二、填空题

Tell me 21.__________ we will see you again.

I’ll tell you all about it 22.__________ I see you again.

Tell me 23.__________ you make the final decision.

It’s been a long day 24.__________ I last met you.

It won’t be long 25.__________ we meet again.

We had dinner together 26.__________ I picked her up at the airport.

I still remember the day27. __________ we first met each other.

I think it will be less than a month 28.__________ she gets ready for her new job.

We must take action right now 29.__________it’s too late.

I have not missed a single game 30.__________ I was seven years old.

三、趣味补充题（节选自《老友记》S07E17）

Chandler: So did Monica tell you about this great band called the Swing Kings that we're trying to get to play at the wedding?

Phoebe: 31.__________ when are you into swing music?

Chandler: Oh 32.__________ forever! I used to go all over town listening to bands!

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
【G95】till，until，not until
一、概念题

till和until都可以翻译成1.__________，not…until可以翻译成2.__________

till和until表示一直3.__________某事，直到某一个4.__________，在这个5.__________之后就6.__________这件事了；而not until是相反的意思，即表示一直7.__________某事，直到某个8.__________，在这个9.__________之后就10.__________这件事了

因为till和until翻译成11.__________，从时间上，明显就表示发生在12.__________，所以till和until引导的从句，一般不会位于13.__________之前

二、按要求构造句子

14. I didn't manage to do it__________ you had explained how.

15.将上面这个句子倒装



16.Not until all the fish died in the river __________ how serious the pollution was. (95 NMET)
A. did the villagers realize
B. the villagers realized
C. the villagers did realize
D. didn't the villagers realize

17.将上面正确的句子改成不倒装的样子



三、兴趣题

接下来的这个句子来源于我好多年前在《经济学人》上读到的一篇文章，叫London is a great cesspool，大家跟着我一步一步还原这个句子。

18.这座城市直到1980年代才回到了中心舞台（翻译）



19.把翻译过的句子倒装：



20.把倒装过的句子强调：



21.把强调过的句子插入一个非限制性定语从句，意为“当伦敦再次繁荣之后”



22.最后再在合适的位置加上同位语

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
【G96】一怎么就
一、概念题

“一…就”之所以算时间状语，是因为它本质上是表示两个动作发生的1.__________挨得非常近

常见的表示“一…就…”的引导词有：2.__________ 3.__________...than…，hardly…4.__________/5.__________，6.__________等

还有些词可以表示“一…就…”：

the相关：the 7.__________，the 8.__________，the 9.__________等

副词：immediately，instantly，directly等

还有些词可以引导时间状语从句，如：

time相关：10.__________，11.__________，12.__________等

以上三组词之所以能够引导时间状语从句，本质上是因为13.______________________________

虽然意思表示“一…就…”的词很多，但是它们还是有细微的差别的，比如有两组词只能表示过去了的，已经发生了的“一…就…”，它们分别是14.____________________，和15.____________________，因此这个时候从句部分的时态应该用16.__________时，而主句的时态应该用17.__________时，并且这个时候句子里面有18.__________副词，因此把它们提到句首的话还会诱发句子的19.__________

二、按要求构造句子

20.她一听到这个消息就昏了过去。（翻译，含than）

【G97】让步状语从句
一、概念题

可以表示“虽然”的连接词有：1.__________，2.__________，3.__________，4.__________

在引导句子的时候，5.__________必须倒装，否则会与它引导的其他状语从句混淆；6.__________可倒装可不倒装；7.__________和8.__________不可倒装，其中后者只能用在句首，原因是用在句中的时候表示的是9.__________，相当于是并列句的转折关系

在Morty老师的体系里，最能体现让步状语从句的两个引导词是10.__________和11.__________，因为它们表达的语气最强烈

可以表示“不管、无论”的引导词有12.__________，13.__________，14.__________等，还有15.__________，16.__________，17.__________也可以，但是前者的使用范围是大于后者的，即前者既可以运用在18.__________从句中，也可以运用在19.__________从句中，而后者只能运用于20.__________从句

whatever对比however：

whatever有21.__________和22.__________两种词性，所以它在从句中可以作23.__________，24.__________，25.__________，或26.__________，而however只有27.__________这种词性，所以它在从句中作28.__________

可以表示“不管是…还是…”的引导词是29.__________

二、填空题

31.__________ you believe it or not, it is true.

【G98】条件状语从句
一、概念题

条件状语从句的标志词有：1.__________，2.__________和3.__________

“除非”转换过来的意思是4.__________，所以如果你想填5.__________，一定要用6.__________来验证一下逻辑通不通

条件状语从句一些不常见的引导词有7.__________，8.__________，9.__________等

if可以翻译成10.__________，11.__________，前者倾向于表达可能实现的事情，后者倾向于表达不可能实现的事情。当说话者认为这件事情不可能发生的时候，就是我们所谓的12.____________________

二、填空题

English is easy to learn 13.__________ you learn it with Morty.

【G99】原因状语从句+一个手表理论
一、概念题

常见的原因状语从句的引导词有：1.__________，2.__________，3.__________，4.__________，其中5.__________语气最为强烈，6.__________次之，7.__________一般翻译成既然，而8.__________的语气是最弱的

不常见的原因状语从句的引导词有：9.__________，10.__________，11.__________，12.__________

because和because of的区别：

because是一个13.__________词，所以它后面要接14.__________，而because of是一个15.__________词，所以它后面要接一个16.__________

一个手表理论：

一个手表理论本质上就是在说连接词的个数等于17.__________

具体的运用有because引导从句的时候不能和18.__________连用；although引导从句的时候不能和19.__________连用。因为because在引导从句的时候代表这个句子是20.__________从句，而21.__________在引导句子的时候，就代表这个句子是22.__________句的23.__________关系，所以两者同时出现，就冲突了；同理，although在引导从句的时候代表这个句子是24.__________从句，而25.__________在引导句子的时候，就代表这个句子是26.__________的27.__________关系，所以两者同时出现，也冲突了

二、填空题

I tell you this 28.__________ there is no shame in getting your money’s worth.

【G100】地点丨目的丨结果状语从句
一、概念题

地点状语从句的引导词一般就是指1.__________，地点状语从句是指由2.__________引导的从句，从3.__________角度修饰主句里面的一个4.__________

5.__________被Morty老师评为最能体现状语从句思维的两个词之一，另外一个词是6.__________

目的状语从句的引导词常见的有7.__________和8.__________，翻译成9.__________

目的状语从句不常见的引导词有10.__________，11.__________和12.__________，翻译成13.__________或14.__________，它其实就是15.__________不，16.__________不的意思

结果状语从句的引导词常见的有17.__________和18.__________，翻译成19.__________

such的词性是20.__________，所以后面要跟21.__________；而so的词性是22.__________，所以后面要跟23.__________或24.__________，但是在Morty老师的体系里，many，much，little和few加名词也叫名词短语，按理说它们应该接在such的后面，但是这是例外，在结果状语从句里，这些短语还是接在25.__________的后面，原因可能是发音的问题，也可能是26.__________修饰的重点就是many，much，little和few而不是它们之后的名词

二、按要求回答问题

“有人的地方就有江湖”

假设这个句子是一句英文，那么它的主句是27.____________________，它的从句是28.____________________，这个句子算29.__________从句，因为它的主句是30.__________的，它的从句是从31.__________角度修饰32.__________词33.__________

假设这个句子是一句英文，那么它是一个34.__________从句，主句部分是35.______________________________，从句部分是36.______________________________，从句部分从37.__________角度修饰整个38.__________，或者说修饰里面的动词39.__________

【G102】状语从句易混淆点全总结
一、概念题

while可以引导两种状语从句，分别是1.__________状语从句，它后面必须加2.__________动词；还有3.__________状语从句，放句首翻译成4.__________，放句中翻译成5.__________，这时其实是并列句的6.__________关系

G112一般现在时丨一般过去时丨一般将来时
一、概念题

请在下面空白处用图形表现出一般现在时，一般过去时和一般将来时

一般现在时的范围可以涵盖 1.______________, 2.______________和3.______________，它是表示经常性，一般性的情况，规律，不随时间的改变而改变；一般过去时表示动作单纯发生在4.______________；一般将来时表示动作单纯发生在5.______________

一般现在时谓语抽象成6.______________或7.______________

一般过去时谓语抽象成8.______________

一般将来时谓语一般抽象成9.______________

一般过去时通常伴随有10.______________的时间状语

一般将来时通常伴随有11.______________的时间状语

一般现在时可能12.______________伴随有时间状语

在Morty老师的体系里，时态被分为了13.______________上的时态和14.______________上的时态

比如主将从现，中的“从现”，就是形式上是15.______________时，意思上就表达的是16.______________时

比如客观真理，科学事实。形式上应该用17.______________时

比如时刻表，即便表达将来的时刻表，形式上也应该用18.______________时

比如祈使句，形式上应该用19.______________时，而意思上天然表20.______________

我们在意思上表达将来有很多方法，可能性从低到高依次是21.______________，22.______________，23.______________，24.______________

情态动词+do，既可以表25.______________，也可以表26.______________

二、按要求回答问题

I will go to the shopping center tomorrow unless it rains.

这个句子的主句部分是27.____________________________

这个句子的从句部分是28.____________________________

这个句子的主句部分的时态是29.______________时，表达的是30.______________（过去/现在/将来）

这个句子的从句部分的时态是31.______________时，表达的是32.______________（过去/现在/将来）

将这个句子改成间接引语，主语是she

33.________________________________________________________

这时，原句中的will go变成了34.______________，即从35.______________时变成了36.______________时，表达的意思也从37.______________变成了38.______________；另外，原句中的rains变成了39.______________，即从40.______________时变成了41.______________时，表达的意思也从一般42.______________表一般43.______________，相应地变成了一般44.______________表45.______________

三、选择题

【练习】

一、概念题

请在下面空白处用图形表现出现在进行时，过去进行时和将来将来时





现在进行时一般抽象成1.______________，表示2.______________发生的动作或者3.______________发生的动作

过去进行时一般抽象成4.______________，表示过去某个5.______________发生的动作或者过去6.______________发生的动作

将来进行时一般抽象成7.______________，表示将来某个8.______________发生的动作或者将来9.______________发生的动作

另外现在进行时还可以表近段时间10.______________的动作，表可能性比较11.______________的一般12.______________的动作，或者表达说话者强烈的13.______________

同样的道理，过去进行时也可以表过去某段时间14.______________的动作，表可能性比较大的过去15.______________的动作，或者表达说话者过去强烈的16.______________

错位叠加法：

错位叠加法是前一种时态的抽象公式的17.______________叠加后一种时态的抽象公式的18.______________

如将来进行时我们可以把它看作是19.______________和20.______________的叠加。一般将来时的抽象公式是21.______________，那么它的首项是22.______________，它的末项是23.______________；进行时的抽象公式是24.______________，那么它的首项是25.______________，它的末项是26.______________；因此我们得出将来进行时的抽象公式是27.______________

再比如过去完成进行时，我们可以把它看作是28.______________，29.______________和30.______________的叠加。一般过去时的抽象公式是31.______________，它的首项是32.______________，它的末项是33.______________；完成时的抽象公式是34.______________，它的首项是35.______________，它的末项是36.______________；进行时的抽象公式是37.______________，它的首项是38.______________，它的末项是39.______________；因此根据错位叠加法，40.______________和41.______________叠加变成42.______________，43.______________和44.______________再叠加变成45.______________，于是我们最终得出过去完成进行时的抽象公式是46.______________
